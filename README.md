Experimental Modpack, very unstable!

**Optimizations/tweaks this modpack applies are very broad and include the following:**

The creative mode search is really unoptimized, in big modpacks, the pressing any key in the text input would freeze the game by a few moments. This improvement implements a smart search algorithm, reusing old results for new searches.
<br>
FPS improvements (client), and benefits depend heavily on PC, mods and the world
<br>
TPS / simulation improvements through faster code and better algorithms
<br>
Lag spike elimination from world generation, light calculations and chunk loads
<br>
RAM savings of around 200 MB for a decent amount of mods
<br>
Faster chunk loading (client/server) and rendering (client)
<br>
Faster game startup
<br>
Minor network bandwidth reduction in some scenarios
<br>
Fog can be toggled in settings
